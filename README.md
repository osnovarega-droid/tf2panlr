## 🛠 Troubleshooting



### Accounts or games fail to launch/accept
**Issue:** The panel does not trigger the game client, or accounts do not start at all.
**Solution:** The panel must be run with **Administrator privileges**.

### How to compile into an .exe file?
1. Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** as **Administrator**.
2. cd {path to folder}
3. pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --clean --name "GoosePanel" --icon=Icon1.ico --add-data "Icon1.ico;." --uac-admin main.py

## ⚙ Account Setup
1. To add accounts, place your `maFiles` (optional) in the `mafiles` folder.
2. Add logins and passwords in the `logpass.txt` file in the format:

```
login:password
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

* The panel allows launching multiple CS2 accounts simultaneously.
* Automatically arranges windows and collects lobbies.
* Works with accounts listed in `logpass.txt` and `maFiles`.


### Functional

* The panel automatically farms keys in cs2, but does not automatically collect items.

### Drop stats

* A drop report was implemented on the history of the sent trade.
